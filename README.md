### Glad to see you here!  
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer whit the passion of coding and a creative mind that i express on my projects.
I'm Italian and i'm 27 years old, after serving my country for 6 years in the Italian Navy i wanted to rebuild my career and starting to learning coding. I've completed a full time bootcamp and learned the basics of front and back end technologies. After i started to working whit a company and start to work as a Front Ende Developer in different projects whit React and Angular- I keep learning more on my own and this gave me more confident in myself.
