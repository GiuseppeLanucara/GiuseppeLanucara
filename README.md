### Glad to see you here!  
Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer with a passion for coding and a creative mindset that I bring into every project.
Iâ€™m Italian and 28 years old. After serving my country for six years in the Italian Navy, I decided to rebuild my career and start learning programming. I completed a full-time bootcamp where I learned the fundamentals of front-end and back-end technologies.

Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve been working as a Front-End Developer, gaining experience with Angular, React, and JSP. Iâ€™ve worked on consulting projects providing support and maintenance, and Iâ€™ve also built front-end applications from scratch that went into production in the healthcare sector.
Iâ€™m constantly learning and expanding my skill set, which has strengthened my confidence and passion for what I do.
